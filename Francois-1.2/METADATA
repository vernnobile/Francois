description: <p>Francois is a reworking of traditional \
  sans serif gothic display typeface forms. In Francois, the earlier \
  letter forms have been digitised and then reshaped \
  for use as a webfont, the counters have been opened \
  up a little and the stems optimised for use as bold \
  display font in modern web browsers. Slanted stem terminals have been added to give the face added visual play.</p>
